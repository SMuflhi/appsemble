# Official Appsemble Blocks

Without blocks it is not possible to develop any interesting apps. To get you started Appsemble
comes with several official blocks that can be used in any app.

These blocks are published and maintained by Appsemble. These can be expected to work with the
current version of Appsemble.

For apps that have more specific needs, itâ€™s possible to
[develop your own blocks](/development/developing-blocks) or use other community-made blocks.
