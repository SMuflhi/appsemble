# Resources

## Introduction

Actions can be used to query the resources as well as perform various operations on resources.
Client side actions are extended from the `request` action, hence they support the fields supported
by the request action and additional fields as specified in every action’s description. To use
resources in your app, you need to define the resources in the `app-definition.yaml file`. Below is
an example of how you can define resources taken from the [Person](/apps/3) app.

```yaml validate
resources:
  person:
    roles:
      - $public # Allow anyone to access the resource’s actions
    schema:
      type: object
      additionalProperties: false
      required:
        - firstName
        - lastName
        - email
      properties:
        firstName:
          type: string
        lastName:
          type: string
        email:
          type: string
          format: email
        description:
          type: string
        picture:
          type: string
          format: binary
```

Resource actions can be used in association with [teams](../../docs/03-guide/teams.md) to limit CRUD
actions on your resources. This can be particularly helpful in separating roles and privileges of
various users in your organization. Following is an example of how you can limit querying `employee`
resources to the members of team and creating resource to the manager.

```yaml validate
resources:
  employee:
    schema:
      type: object
      additionalProperties: false
      required:
        - firstName
        - lastName
        - email
        - department
    properties:
      firstName:
        type: string
      lastName:
        type: string
      email:
        type: string
        format: email
      department:
        type: enum
        enum: ['HR', 'Engineering', 'Marketing', 'Data', 'Security']
      picture:
        type: string
        format: binary
    create:
      roles:
        - $team:manager
    query:
      roles:
        - $teams:member
```

Supported resource actions are as below:

- `resource.get`
- `resource.query`
- `resource.count`
- `resource.create`
- `resource.update`
- `resource.patch`
- `resource.delete`

- `resource.subscription.unsubscribe`
- `resource.subscription.toggle`
- `resource.subscription.status`
