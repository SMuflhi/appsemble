# Flow

## Introduction

Flow actions allow users to navigate through a flow page. To know more about how data is managed on
the flow pages visit [app storage](/docs/03-guide/storage#storage). These actions are client side
actions, i.e. these actions are not implemented for the server side. The following are the supported
flow actions.

- `flow.next`
- `flow.finish`
- `flow.back`
- `flow.cancel`
- `flow.to`

### flow.next

On a flow page, this action proceed to the next page if it is present. Otherwise, the flow is
considered to be complete and [\`flow.finish\`](#flowfinish) will be called instead. Supported field
for this action is `type`, which is `flow.next` in this case. Here is an example of this action
being used.

```yaml validate
blocks:
  - type: button-list
    version: *blocks-version
    parameters:
      buttons:
        - label: { translate: start }
          onClick: onStart
          color: primary
    actions:
      onStart:
        type: flow.next
```

### flow.finish

On a flow page, this action triggers the `onFlowFinish` action on the page. Supported field for this
action is `type`, which is `flow.finish` in this case. Here is an example of this action being used.

```yaml validate
blocks:
  - type: form
    version: *blocks-version
    parameters:
      fields:
        - type: string
          name: finishStep
          label: { translate: finishStep }
    actions:
      onSubmit:
        type: flow.finish
```

### flow.back

On a flow page, this action returns to the previous page if it is present. If this action is called
on the first page, nothing happens. Supported field for this action is `type`, which is `flow.back`
in this case. Here is an example of this action being used.

```yaml validate
blocks:
  - type: form
    version: *blocks-version
    parameters:
      fields:
        - type: string
          name: email
          label: { translate: email }
    actions:
      onPrevious:
        type: flow.back
```

### flow.cancel

On a flow page, calling this action triggers the `onFlowCancel` action. Supported field for this
action is `type`, which is `flow.cancel` in this case. Here is an example of how to use this action.

```yaml validate
blocks:
  - type: action-button
    version: *blocks-version
    parameters:
      icon: ban
    actions:
      onClick:
        type: flow.cancel
```

### flow.to

On a flow page, this action is used to move to a specific step. Supported fields for this action are
`type` and `step`. Step is the name of the step to move to, this is a remapper which gets called
with the action input and current context, the type is `flow.to`. Both fields are required. Here is
how you can use this action in your app.

```yaml validate
blocks:
  - type: form
    version: *blocks-version
    parameters:
      fields:
        - name: username
          label: { translate: username }
          requirements: { required: true }
          type: string
    actions:
      onSubmit:
        type: flow.to
        step: Home
```
